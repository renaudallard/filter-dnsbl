.Pq a domain name
and by default drops the connection if it is found.
If the

with an X-Spam and X-Spam-DNSBL header.
For more verbose logging the
.Fl v
flag can be used.
If the
.Fl a

rejection message. This is mostly useful when the query contains a key.
If the
.Fl p
flag is specified, the message will be permanently rejected with a 550 error
code.
